# Taquin Game Project

Welcome to the Taquin Game project! üéÆ This guide will help you get started with Git and GitHub so that our collaboration runs smoothly.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
To start working on the project, you need to copy (clone) the repository to your local machine.

Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:zkhribach/taquin-game.git
cd taquin-game
```

---

### 2. **Create Your Own Branch**
Never work directly on the `main` branch. Create your own branch for each task you are working on.

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
Replace `your-branch-name` with something meaningful:
- `game-logic`
- `input-output`
- `file-save-load`
- `testing`

---

### 3. **Make Changes**
1. Write or modify the code in your branch.
2. Stage the changes (prepare them for commit):
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Short description of the changes"
   ```

Example commit message:
```bash
git commit -m "Add function to shuffle the board"
```

---

### 4. **Push Your Branch to GitHub**
Upload your branch to GitHub so others can see your changes:
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

---

### 5. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
Once your changes are ready:
1. Go to [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zkhribach/taquin-game).
2. You will see a **"Compare & Pull Request"** button. Click it.
3. Write a description of what you did and submit the PR.

A team member will review your PR, suggest changes if needed, and merge it into the `main` branch.

---

## üîÑ Stay Updated with Main Branch

Before starting new work or to avoid conflicts, always update your local `main` branch:

1. Switch to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. Update your working branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout your-branch-name
   git merge main
   ```
